Nora-TS is a Solana-based trading library offering a robust platform for building sophisticated trading systems on Nora, combining WebSocket-based real-time connectivity with advanced analytics, risk management, and AI capabilities specifically designed for the Solana ecosystem. Here's a detailed breakdown of its functionality and features:

---

### **Core Features**

#### **Real-time WebSocket Integration**
- Provides seamless WebSocket connections to Solana nodes and Nora services.
- Facilitates real-time data streaming for Solana market data, trades, and order book updates.
- Automatic reconnection ensures minimal disruption during network failures.

#### **Technical Analysis**
- Offers a rich suite of technical indicators optimized for Solana markets:
  - **SMA (Simple Moving Average):** Identifies trend directions in Solana token pairs.
  - **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** Measures the magnitude of recent price changes.
  - **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):** Tracks momentum and trend strength.
  - **Bollinger Bands:** Assesses volatility and price levels.
- Functions can be applied directly to historical Solana market data for actionable insights.

#### **Risk Management**
- Enforces disciplined trading through robust risk management strategies:
  - Risk-per-trade and maximum position size constraints.
  - Tools for calculating position size based on entry, stop loss, and target prices.
  - Trade validation mechanisms for evaluating risk-to-reward ratios.

#### **AI/ML Integration**
- Supports custom AI/ML models for Solana market analysis and automated trading:
  - Build models tailored to specific Solana market conditions or token pairs.
  - Leverage machine learning to forecast trends, execute trades, and manage risks dynamically.
- Models can output actionable signals with confidence scores and reasoning.

#### **Performance Analytics**
- Advanced tools for assessing trading performance:
  - **Sharpe Ratio:** Evaluates risk-adjusted returns.
  - **Maximum Drawdown:** Quantifies peak-to-trough equity declines.
- Analytics are integral to iterative improvement and performance tuning.

#### **Position Management**
- Enables precise tracking and adjustment of open positions.
- Tracks metrics such as unrealized profit/loss and equity allocation.

#### **WebSocket API Functions**
The library provides comprehensive WebSocket functionality:

- **Market Data Operations**
  ```typescript
  // Subscribe to real-time updates for a specific mint
  client.subscribe('SOL');
  
  // Unsubscribe from updates
  client.unsubscribe('SOL');
  
  // Fetch historical data
  client.history('SOL', startTimestamp, endTimestamp);
  ```

- **Trading Signals**
  ```typescript
  // Subscribe to trading signals
  client.subscribeSignal('15m', 0.75); // 15-minute timeframe, 0.75 confidence threshold
  
  // Unsubscribe from signals
  client.unsubscribeSignal('15m');
  ```

- **Strategy Management**
  ```typescript
  // Create a new trading strategy
  client.createStrategy('MA_Crossover');
  
  // Get list of available strategies
  client.getStrategies();
  ```

- **Account Operations**
  ```typescript
  // Get account balance
  client.getBalance();
  
  // Execute trades
  client.executeTrade('buy', { mint: 'SOL', amountSol: 1.5 });
  client.executeTrade('sell', { mint: 'SOL', amountSol: 0.5 });
  ```

#### **Event Handling**
The client emits various events that you can listen to:
- `connected`: Connection established
- `disconnected`: Connection lost
- `message`: Real-time market data
- `signal`: Trading signals
- `strategy`: Strategy updates
- `strategies`: List of strategies
- `balance`: Account balance updates
- `transaction`: Trade execution updates
- `error`: Error events

### **Installation and Quick Start**

#### **Installation**
To include the Nora trading library in your project, use:
```bash
npm install @Nora/solana-trading-lib
```

#### **Quick Start Example**
```typescript
import { CryptoWebSocketClient } from '@Nora/solana-trading-lib';

const client = new CryptoWebSocketClient('YOUR_API_KEY');

// Connect to the WebSocket server
client.connect();

// Event listeners
client.on('connected', () => {
  console.log('Connected to WebSocket server');
  
  // Subscribe to a specific mint
  client.subscribe('SOL');
  
  // Request historical data
  client.history('SOL', Date.now() - 3600000, Date.now()); // Last hour
  
  // Subscribe to trading signals
  client.subscribeSignal('5m', 0.8); // 5-minute timeframe, 0.8 threshold
});

client.on('message', (data) => {
  console.log('Received market data:', data);
});

client.on('signal', (signal) => {
  console.log('Received trading signal:', signal);
});

client.on('balance', (balance) => {
  console.log('Account balance:', balance);
});

client.on('transaction', (tx) => {
  console.log('Transaction completed:', tx);
});
```

### **Customization and Flexibility**

#### **WebSocket Options**
- Allows connection customization with options such as:
  - Auto-reconnection with interval specification.
  - API URL overrides for private or sandbox environments.

#### **Risk Parameters**
- Tailor risk management to individual trading styles or account sizes:
```typescript
const NoraRiskManager = new NoraRiskManager({
  accountBalance: 50000,
  maxRiskPerTrade: 0.01, // 1% risk
  maxPositionSize: 0.05, // 5% of total capital
  network: 'mainnet-beta' // Solana network specification
});
```

#### **AI Model Integration**
- Plug-and-play interface for AI models:
```typescript
class MyAIModel extends AIModelInterface {
  async getPrediction(request) {
    // Custom logic
    return { action: 'sell', confidence: 0.9 };
  }
}
```
